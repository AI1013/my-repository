# popadmix app
A web application for making the plots about Fst or Hadm.

## overview
This web application can make the triangle plots, which can  show the Fst or the the heterozygosity of an admixed population between a population and hypothetical admixtures of that population with two other populations at different loci. These loci can only be from the `allele.frequencies.no.extra.RData`. 
For more details, please see the [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3206961/):

Boca, Simina M., and Noah A. Rosenberg. "Mathematical properties of Fst between admixed populations and their parental source populations."Â Theoretical population biology80.3 (2011): 208-216.
